# Jewelry-Business-Optimization

**Objective**
This project portfolio aims to leverage traditional machine learning techniques and analytics to drive actionable insights for a jewelry business. By focusing on projects that exclude deep learning, this collection will showcase my proficiency in Python programming and data analysis while addressing key business challenges through data-driven solutions. Each project aligns with the goal of improving sales, customer engagement, inventory management, and overall business operations.


**Tools and Libraries**
Python Libraries:
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib/Seaborn: Data visualization.
- Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms (regression, classification, clustering).
- Statsmodels: For statistical models, especially time series forecasting (ARIMA, SARIMA).
- SciPy: For optimization techniques (linear programming, integer programming).


**The following projects are included in this portfolio:**
1. Sales Forecasting (Time Series Analysis):
Use ARIMA, SARIMA, or Prophet to forecast monthly or weekly sales, helping with inventory planning by identifying demand patterns.

2. Customer Segmentation (Clustering):
Employ K-Means or Hierarchical Clustering to group customers based on purchasing behavior, enabling personalized marketing strategies.

3. Market Basket Analysis (Association Rule Mining):
Utilize the Apriori or FP-growth algorithms to uncover product associations, optimizing product bundling and improving cross-selling opportunities.

4. Churn Prediction (Customer Retention):
Implement logistic regression, decision trees, or random forests to identify at-risk customers, allowing for targeted retention strategies.

5. Sales Performance by Product & Supplier:
Analyze revenue, units sold, and profit margins through visualizations and pivot tables to focus on best-performing products and suppliers.

6. Price Optimization:
Use linear regression or decision trees to model price elasticity, determining optimal price points for maximizing revenue.

7. Inventory Management Optimization:
Use linear programming to optimize stock levels across products and predict inventory needs based on historical sales data.

8. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Prediction:
Estimate customer lifetime value using regression models to identify and prioritize high-value customers.


**Conclusion**
By executing these projects, I aim to practice core data science skills, including data cleaning, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. Each project will provide actionable insights that can directly support business strategies and decision-making processes, ultimately contributing to the growth and success of the jewelry business.

Through this portfolio, I aspire to demonstrate my capability to translate complex data into meaningful insights, showing how data science can significantly impact and enhance business operations in the jewelry industry.
